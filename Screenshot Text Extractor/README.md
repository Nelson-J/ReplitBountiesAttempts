**Problem Description**

You are given a folder with screenshots of individuals who attended an event. The attendees are shown by their full name, followed by the company they work for, followed by a hyphen and their role at the company.

For example, it'll say:

"John Doe
Robinhood - software engineer"
which means the full name is 'John Doe', the company name is 'Robinhood', and the role is 'software engineer'.

***Goal*** 
Client wants to be able to extract this information from all screenshots and get them in a CSV which has all the attendee data formatted as {attendee full name, company name, role name}.
