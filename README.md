**Bounties on Replit**

Replit is an online platform that allows you to write and run code (Software as a Service). 
Users can equally learn how to code, through some challenges. 

Other people use the platform to seek the services of coders, by creating (adding) bounties.

This Repo is a record of my attempts of some Replit bounties
